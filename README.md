# Xbox-Live-Status

I am very new to this but first off credit for the base logic goees to iBeech/SmartThings specifically the plex implmentation.  

This smartthings xbox live status allows smartthings device to show current status of your user account.  This can be used to dim the lights when an app opens or dim the lights when it first turns on.   This plus the above plex implementation semi automates my home theater lighting.  

https://xapi.us/ signup is required with the free account.  This is the API key requested.  You must use the login from your xbox live account. 


This isn't fully working yet.  Pretty close though.
